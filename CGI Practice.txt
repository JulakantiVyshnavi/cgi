***Algorithm for accepting two numbers, divide first number by second and display quotient.***
1)Start
2)Accept the first number and store it in a variable "num1"
3)Accept the second number and store it in a variable "num2"
4)If num2 is equal to 0, display an error message "Cannot divide by zero" and stop the program.
5)Otherwise, divide num1 by num2 and store the quotient in a variable "result".
6)Display the value of "result".
7)Stop.

*Example program in python*
num1 = float(input("Enter the first number: "))
num2 = float(input("Enter the second number: "))

if num2 == 0:
    print("Error: Cannot divide by zero")
else:
    result = num1 / num2
    print("The quotient is: ", result)
	
***algorithm to take input in kilometers and convert into meters and display the result***
*Start
*Accept the distance in kilometers and store it in a variable "distance_km".
*Multiply the distance_km by 1000 to convert it into meters, and store the result in a variable "distance_m".
*Display the value of "distance_m".
*Stop.

*Example program in python*	
distance_km = float(input("Enter the distance in kilometers: "))
distance_m = distance_km * 1000
print("The distance in meters is:", distance_m)

*** ake 5 numbers and find avg and sum***
Start
Accept the first number and store it in a variable "num1".
Accept the second number and store it in a variable "num2".
Accept the third number and store it in a variable "num3".
Accept the fourth number and store it in a variable "num4".
Accept the fifth number and store it in a variable "num5".
Calculate the sum of all the numbers by adding them together, and store the result in a variable "total".
Calculate the average of the numbers by dividing the total by 5, and store the result in a variable "average".
Display the value of "total" and "average".
Stop.
 Example program in python
 num1 = float(input("Enter the first number: "))
num2 = float(input("Enter the second number: "))
num3 = float(input("Enter the third number: "))
num4 = float(input("Enter the fourth number: "))
num5 = float(input("Enter the fifth number: "))

total = num1 + num2 + num3 + num4 + num5
average = total / 5

print("The sum of the numbers is:", total)
print("The average of the numbers is:", average)

***take a number and find it odd or even***
Start
Accept a number as input and store it in a variable "num".
Divide the number by 2 and check the remainder. If the remainder is 0, the number is even. If the remainder is 1, the number is odd.
If the remainder is 0, display a message "The number is even".
If the remainder is 1, display a message "The number is odd".
Stop.
**Example program in python**
num = int(input("Enter a number: "))
if num % 2 == 0:
    print("The number is even")
else:
    print("The number is odd")
